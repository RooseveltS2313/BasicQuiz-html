# BasicQuiz-html
Student Self-made Assignment for Introductory Web Design Final
The goal of the project was to make an example website that served as a questionaire. There were 20 questions required
and I chose the topic of leaves.
This was made my second year into university and was one of my areas of growth as it shows what I thought was acceptable 
website design at the time.

The code itself it a mixture of javascript and html to randomize the quiz with a generated 'seed' for the correct answers
availbale.
